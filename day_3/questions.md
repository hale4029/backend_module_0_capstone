## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.

  - A conditional statement evaluates a condition, "then tells the data where to go based on defined parameters".
    1. if-statement functions
    2. loops function
    3. conditionals within if functions

1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?

 - Determine if a variable or comparison is valid before performing the next step/function (e.g. sending data, calculation)
 - Advanced decision tree code that evaluates many inputs before calculation or output.

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?

    `if
      instructions
    elsif
      instructions
    elsif
      instructions
    else
      instructions
    end`

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?

- nested if functions - if statements within if statements

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement?

    if
     puts
    elsif
     puts
    else
    end

1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?

  - `?` at then end of a method can be used to create a conditional or at least be an element of one
