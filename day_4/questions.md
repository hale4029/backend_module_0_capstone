## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?

  - To create a dynamic function which receives data, performs some action, then outputs a value. The method is useful because if can be applied many times without eliminating the need to type all the method's arguments repeatedly.  

1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

    `def hello(sentence)
      puts sentence
    end

    hello("Sam I am")`

1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.

    `def hello_someone(name)
      puts "#{name} I am"
    end

    hello_someone("Harrison")`

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

  - `hello_someone("_type name_")`

1. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?

  - When would you opt not to create a method? Only when it would have little use elsewhere?
  - Are methods utilized more in back-end or front-end design? Thinking backend...
