# Ceasar Cipher

  - start by creating an array (or maybe a hash) that contains all the letters of the alphabet, that way each letter is assigned to a number.
  - given that each element of an array is assigned to a number, i'd have to create a method (encode) that searches for the letter, retrieves the original index number associated with that letter, subtract by (shift amount), then retrieve the letter associated with the new number.


# Checker Board

  - I think some kind of printing loop function may take in integer input and then print a repeating sequence.
  - The sequence will have to be offset so each line either starts with " " or X.
  - The printing needs to be proportional from a length/width standpoint
    - may need a nested function of some kind.
